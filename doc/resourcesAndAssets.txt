Engine start:
    find all assetDbs
    for each assetDb:
        zero out assetDb working set
        load assetDb from hu
        diff the assetDbs
        clear diff.lastCacheModTime changed bit
        for each asset in assetDb:
            find source file, if any, get mod time, other info
        find cache file, if any, get mod time


When assetDb.diff has changes (including at startup):
    if cache changed:
        TODO: handle new cache file creation and cache-cache transfer
    if lastCachedModTime changed:
        TODO: handle reload of assetDb from hu
    if assets changed:
        determine if any cached data has changed
        if so:
            determine if the data must grow in size or have a stricter alignment
        ... we can refine this down, and go up as far as 'if assets changed, reload the works'
        compute and accrue the assigned buffer/image layout reqs
    if any b/i layout changes, inform the memory manager of the new layout
    (mm will move what it can (if an asset doesn't need reimporting))
    mm will schedule transfers for any missing asset data


mm is using large staging buffers that it keeps around, each big enough to move
a huge amount (256 MB or so). Perhaps two buffers, for pipelining.

mm gets a structure that looks like (given by examining the object/feature set):
featureDb: [ {
        assetDbAddress: [assetDb0, 2]
        memoryProperties: deviceLocal
        size:   1632
        usages: [transfer_dst_bit,      // comes from the asset
                 vertex_buffer_bit]     // comes from the feature
                                        // another feature might set, say, uniform_buffer_bit.
                                        // But that will coalesce during plan-making phase.
        queues: [[transfer, transfer_write_bit, transfer_bit],
                 // queue  // VK_ACCESS        VK_PIPELINE_STAGE
                           // set by engine if there is a transfer-only queue available
                 // another feature might set, say, [compute, ...]
                 // but that will coalesce during plan-making phase.
                 [graphics, shader_read_bit, vertex_shader_bit]]   // comes from the feature
        dedicated: true
    }, {
        assetDbAddress: [0, 1]
        memoryProperties: deviceLocal
        size:   1200
        usages: [transfer_dst_bit, index_buffer_bit]
        queues: [[transfer, transfer_write_bit, transfer_bit],
                 [graphics, shader_read_bit, index_shader_bit]]
        dedicated: true
        address: ... TBD
    }, {
        ... shaders too, etc
    }
]

and arranges it into:

featureDb: {
    memoryPlan: [ {
            memoryType 0: [ { // alloc 0
                    memoryProperties: deviceLocal

                            sharingMode: exclusive?
                            queues: [compute, graphics]
                            subresources: [ {
                                    assetCache: vertices (assetDb: 0 page: 0 asset: 0)   // not all subresources will have an asset in cache
                                    usages: [transfer_dst_bit, vertex_buffer_bit, uniform_buffer_bit]
                                    size:   2000
                                } {
                                    assetCache: indices (assetDb: 0 page: 0 asset: 1)
                                    usages: [transfer_dst_bit, index_buffer_bit, uniform_buffer_bit]
                                    size:   1200
                                }
                            ]
                        }, {
                            ...
                        }
                    ]
                }, {        // alloc 1
                    memoryProperties: deviceLocal
                }
            ]
            memoryType 1: [
                    ...
            ]
        }
    ]
    shaderPlan: [ {

        }
    ]
    pipelinePlan: [ {

        }
    ]
    descriptorSetPlan: [ {

        }
    ]
}

and allocates large blocks for any shortfalls from what it has.

Now mm has to track the window state of each assetdb's filemap. This sounds
like a really low level probing, but it's not bad. We cannot schedule more
than the window size (256MB probably) from any one assetDb, since we have to
keep the window there until the transfers are done. We can, however, schedule
as many assetDbs as we want at once.

Now mm builds a schedule to fill out its needs:

setWindow   0
assetDb0        schedule buffers 0, 3-45 buffers 46-123 images 124-135 buffers 136-151
assetDb1        schedule buffers 0-12 images 13-44
clearStaging
assetDb2        schedule buffers 0-88 images 89-192
...
setWindow   1
assetDb0        schedule buffers 152-164 images 165-211
assetDb1        schedule images 45-90
clearStaging
...

All the VkBuffer and VkImage objects can be created now, and should be (in
parallel). Their respective resources can be informed of their new Vk*
objects / offsets if they change. If there are fallback assets, the resource
will use a different Vk* object until its transfer is complete.

Each setWindow and clearStaging step must wait on previous scheduled transfers
to complete. The engine should consider advancing a frame on those steps. (The
number of paging cycles to run per frame shoudld be tunable.)

If the memory plan is stateful, we should always be able to create a schedule
to get to a desired memory plan from wherever we currently are. So changes to
the assets should be responsive even if we're in the middle of a multi-frame
transfer schedule.

In making a memory schedule, we should be working towards a 'plan that works.'
It's not as important to match a plan's layout as to satisfy fragmentation
reqs, however that is done quickest. So if plan a specifies db0 then db1, and
plan b specifies db1, db0, the plans are still 'compatible' and no schedule is
requierd at all, as long as there are no gaps to fill by settling suballocs.

Other operations may be put into the schedule. If there is a memory plan in
place already, the diff to get from a to b will have other things like memory
transfers and entire allocs and deallocs. This can go right into the schedule
and be acted on in turn.



Objects

Objects are basically feature containers. They represent instances of things
in a sim environment. Each has a set of Features which define it.

A Feature is an object that describes how to use the object to the engine. Mesh
rendering is a feature, being a light source, being a camera, being a skybox.
Features may require other features to be owned by the same object to work.
Features reference assets, and describe their usages. When a memory plan is
being created, the active feature set describes the usage bits and other things.
So, only active features (even those that are marked 'disabled') will inform
a memory plan. This makes for gaps in assetDb caches, which will need to be
skipped when memcpying.
